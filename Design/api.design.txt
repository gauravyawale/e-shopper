2. Admin-Specific API Endpoints

Get all users:
GET /admin/users
Retrieves a list of all users (with pagination).
Get a specific user:
GET /admin/users/:id
Retrieves details of a specific user.
Update user information:
PUT /admin/users/:id
Admin can update user information.
Delete user:
DELETE /admin/users/:id
Deletes a user (soft delete or permanent).
Product (Items) Management
Admins should be able to add, update, and delete products in the catalog.

Get all items:
GET /admin/items
Retrieves a list of all items with filters like stock status, categories, etc.
Add new item:
POST /admin/items
Adds a new product to the catalog. Includes fields like name, price, description, stock, category, etc.
Update item:
PUT /admin/items/:id
Updates product information (e.g., stock levels, price, description).
Delete item:
DELETE /admin/items/:id
Removes an item from the catalog (soft delete or permanent).
Order Management
Admins need to track, update, and manage orders across the platform.

Get all orders:
GET /admin/orders
Retrieves a list of all orders, with filters for status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).
Get a specific order:
GET /admin/orders/:id
Retrieves details of a specific order.
Update order status:
PUT /admin/orders/:id
Admin can change the status of an order (e.g., mark as shipped or delivered).
Delete an order:
DELETE /admin/orders/:id
Cancels an order (usually only allowed if not yet processed).
Review Management
Admins need control over user reviews for products to moderate content.

Get all reviews for moderation:
GET /admin/reviews
Lists all reviews for products, with the ability to filter based on product or user.
Delete a review:
DELETE /admin/reviews/:reviewId
Allows admin to delete reviews if they violate policies.
Cart Management
Admins might want to inspect a userâ€™s cart to understand issues or manage abandoned carts.

Get user cart:
GET /admin/cart/:userId
Retrieves the current cart contents of a user.
Payment Management
Admins need access to payment and transaction details to verify or manage refunds.

Get payment details:
GET /admin/payments
Lists all payment transactions with filters (e.g., status: paid, failed).
View payment for an order:
GET /admin/payments/:orderId
Retrieves the payment details for a specific order.
3. Admin Dashboard APIs
The admin dashboard typically needs aggregate data for better management and decision-making.

Dashboard overview:
GET /admin/dashboard
Provides a summary of important metrics like:
Total users
Total orders
Total sales (amount)
Pending orders
Active users
Items in stock/out of stock
Sales report:
GET /admin/reports/sales?startDate&endDate
Provides sales reports for a given period.
User registration report:
GET /admin/reports/users?startDate&endDate
Provides data on user registrations within a specific timeframe.
4. Additional Considerations for Admin APIs
Authentication and Authorization
Admin APIs need to be protected, and only authorized admins should be able to access them.

Use JWT (JSON Web Token) or similar tokens for secure authentication.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC):
Only users with the role "admin" should access the admin APIs.
Admins may have specific permissions (e.g., manage products, manage users).
Logging and Audit
All admin actions should be logged for auditing purposes.
Changes to critical data (like orders, items, or user accounts) should be traceable, including which admin performed the action.
Security Considerations
Protect sensitive endpoints with proper authorization.
Regularly audit security, especially regarding admin privileges.
Implement throttling/rate limiting on admin APIs to prevent abuse.
